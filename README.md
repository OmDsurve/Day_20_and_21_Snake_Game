# Day_20_and_21_Snake_Game
I created a Snake Game where the player controls a snake to eat food, which makes the snake grow longer. The game features collision detection with both the walls and the snake's own tail, ending the game if a collision occurs. The score increases with each food eaten, and the game is built using Python's Turtle module
